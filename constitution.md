[TODO explain consensus in 'parliamentary procedure' section]

[TODO How can or can't an individual represent Hacks? What kinds of executive decisions are made by consensus/plurality/majority?]

Furthermore, an active member cannot be guilty of being a total fuckwad. List possible infractions here.

### Section 7:
A nominee is voted into office by obtaining a simple majority of votes via the *instant-runoff* process. The instant-runoff process is defined as follows:
>Ballots are initially distributed based on each elector's first preference. If a candidate secures more >than half of votes cast, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is >eliminated. Ballots assigned to the eliminated candidate are recounted and assigned to those of the >remaining candidates who rank next in order of preference on each ballot. This process continues until >one candidate wins by obtaining more than half the votes.

Notice of the proposed amendment must be presented in writing at least one meeting prior to the vote. The text of the amendment must be posted conspicuously for the inspection of the Voting Members. 

### Section 3: Voting Process
In the interest of transparency, efficiency, and fun, the primary voting process for amendments will be [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Voting Members seeking to edit the constitution will submit a pull request with their changes, 
[TODO Let's figure this out. I think it would be really cool to do amendments by PR (this is in a repo, after all), but I'm not sure how the actual voting works. Should we have people submit a PR and then vote on it traditionally at the meeting, or should we let people vote in the comments. I like the comments, but what if the submitter modifies the amendment after people cast their votes?]


The Hacks Advisory Board may opt instead to hold a traditional vote with paper ballots. However, this decision must be made at least one meeting prior to the vote and must be well-publicized to current Voting Members.
