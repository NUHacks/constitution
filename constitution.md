[TODO explain consensus in 'parliamentary procedure' section]

[TODO How can or can't an individual represent Hacks? What kinds of executive decisions are made by consensus/plurality/majority?]

If an individual can list five active members of Hacks that can affirm said individual is an active member of Hacks, then the afformentioned individual is in fact an active member of Hacks. Web of trust model.

Furthermore, an active member cannot be guilty of being a total fuckwad. List possible infractions here.

If an individual is not an active member, the Advisory Board may choose, by consensus, to disregard the non-active member's votes.

[TODO rest of constitution]
